## Usage plain svg

## Usage with `@db-ui/components`

### Import

There are different ways to include the icons via a font-face. Therefore, you need to import the correct `.css` file. There are multiple files depending on the bundler you use:

- `relative.css`: No bundler
- `absolute.css`: No bundler
- `rollup.css`: `vite`, `rollup`
- `webpack.css`: `webpack`

#### JS/TS

```javascript
// main.[js|ts]
import "@db-ux/pv-icons/dist/css/rollup.css";
```

#### CSS

```css
/* main.css */
@import "@db-ux/pv-icons/dist/css/rollup.css";
```

### Use Font-Family

If you want to use the font family you can do it like this:

#### HTML

```html
<button class="db-button" data-icon="air_condition" data-icon-variant="db-pv">
  Test
</button>
```

#### Angular

```html
<db-button icon="air_condition" data-icon-variant="db-pv">Test</db-button>
```

#### React & Vue

```tsx
<DBButton icon="air_condition" data-icon-variant="db-pv">Test</DBButton>
```

You can add additional TypeScript support by including generated types to `tsconfig.json`:

```json
React:
{
  "compilerOptions": ...,
  "include": [..., "node_modules/@db-ux/pv-icons/dist/types/react.d.ts"],
}

Vue:
{
  "compilerOptions": ...,
  "include": [..., "node_modules/@db-ux/pv-icons/dist/types/vue.d.ts"],
}
```
